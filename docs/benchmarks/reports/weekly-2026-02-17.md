# Weekly Benchmark and Quality Report (2026-02-17)

## Scope
- Initial runnable governance gateway baseline.
- Week-4 benchmark harness scenario matrix with dataset-driven runs.

## Test Summary
- `ruff check .`: pass
- `mypy app scripts`: pass
- `pytest`: pass (`24 passed`)
- `scripts/validate_schemas.py`: pass
- `scripts/compose_smoke.sh`: pass

## Benchmark Snapshot
- Scenarios: `direct_provider`, `observe_mode`, `enforce_redact`
- Dataset: `benchmarks/data/synthetic_prompts.jsonl`
- Output path: `artifacts/benchmarks`
- Generated artifacts per scenario:
  - `raw/request_metrics.csv`
  - `results_summary.json`
  - `report.md`

## Benchmark Delta
- Prior week: baseline skeleton for single scenario.
- Current week: scenario matrix added to compare governance posture and overhead under consistent dataset input.

## Known Limitations
- Provider and policy integration are currently stubbed for deterministic local behavior.
- Redaction engine is regex-based and needs precision/recall tuning against larger corpora.
- Benchmark harness emits synthetic metrics; live-load and fault-injection integration is pending.
