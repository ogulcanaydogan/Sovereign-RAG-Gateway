# Weekly Benchmark and Quality Report (2026-02-17)

## Scope
- Initial runnable governance gateway baseline.
- Week-4 skeleton benchmark harness output.

## Test Summary
- `ruff check .`: pass
- `mypy app scripts`: pass
- `pytest`: pass (`20 passed`)
- `scripts/validate_schemas.py`: pass
- `scripts/compose_smoke.sh`: pass

## Benchmark Snapshot
- Scenario: `enforce_redact`
- Output path: `artifacts/benchmarks`
- Generated artifacts:
  - `raw/request_metrics.csv`
  - `results_summary.json`
  - `report.md`

## Benchmark Delta
- Prior week: none (first baseline).
- Current week: baseline established; future weeks should compare p95 latency, leakage, and cost drift.

## Known Limitations
- Provider and policy integration are currently stubbed for deterministic local behavior.
- Redaction engine is regex-based and needs precision/recall tuning against larger corpora.
- Benchmark harness currently emits baseline skeleton outputs; scenario breadth will expand next iteration.
