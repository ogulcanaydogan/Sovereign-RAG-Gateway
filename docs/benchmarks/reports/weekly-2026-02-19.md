# Weekly Report - 2026-02-19

## Scope
- SharePoint enterprise connector coverage
- Webhook dead-letter replay operations
- Runtime-controls v0.5 foundation CI hardening
- Governance trend regression gate

## Changes Shipped
- Added SharePoint read-only connector and settings wiring.
- Added dead-letter replay CLI:
  - `scripts/replay_webhook_dead_letter.py`
- Added governance trend regression checker:
  - `scripts/check_benchmark_trend.py`
- Added baseline file:
  - `benchmarks/baselines/governance_enforce_redact_summary.json`
- Extended CI:
  - Redis service in test workflow
  - dead-letter replay smoke step
  - benchmark trend gate
  - deploy-smoke runtime-controls step (kind)

## Verification (Local)
- `ruff`: pass
- `mypy`: pass
- `pytest`: `158 passed, 4 skipped`
- `scripts/validate_schemas.py`: pass
- `scripts/check_version_sync.py`: pass
- `scripts/check_benchmark_trend.py`: pass

## Runtime Controls Smoke
- Added script: `deploy/kind/runtime-controls-smoke.sh`
- Local execution status: blocked (`helm` missing in local environment).
- CI execution path: wired in `.github/workflows/deploy-smoke.yml` under `Runtime controls smoke tests`.

## Known Limitations
- Local kind runtime-controls validation requires `helm` binary.
- Prerelease tagging/publishing remains pending (`v0.5.0-alpha.1` draft notes prepared).

## Next Checkpoint
1. Run deploy-smoke workflow on branch/PR and capture runtime-controls smoke output.
2. Promote `docs/releases/v0.5.0-alpha.1.md` to tagged prerelease once checks pass.
