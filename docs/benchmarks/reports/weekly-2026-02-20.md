# Weekly Report - 2026-02-20

## Scope
This report closes the v0.5.0-alpha.1 runtime-controls validation requirement using the kind smoke path in CI.

## Validation Evidence
- Workflow: `deploy-smoke`
- Run ID: `22207623171`
- Event: `push` on `main`
- Completed: `2026-02-20T01:32:46Z`

- Result: `success`

## Runtime-Controls Checks Covered
- Kind cluster bootstrap and Helm deployment
- Gateway readiness/liveness checks
- Trace diagnostics span-chain verification for request lifecycle
- Budget guardrail denial path (`429 budget_exceeded`)
- Webhook dead-letter file presence after unreachable endpoint simulation

## Outcome
Runtime-controls stack validation in the kind smoke environment passed with CI evidence. This satisfies the roadmap item for weekly publication of runtime-controls smoke validation.
