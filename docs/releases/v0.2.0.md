# v0.2.0 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-18

## Highlights
- Added production-ready Helm packaging under `charts/sovereign-rag-gateway` with secure defaults and values schema validation.
- Added reproducible local cluster deployment under `deploy/kind` and a runbook in `docs/operations/helm-kind-runbook.md`.
- Added `deploy-smoke` CI workflow to verify install, rollout, and endpoint health checks on kind.
- Added release automation with semver tag validation, changelog-backed notes, image publishing to GHCR, keyless cosign signing, SBOM generation, and provenance attestations.

## Operational Notes
- Container startup now runs `uvicorn` directly from the built virtualenv (`/app/.venv/bin/uvicorn`) to keep runtime compatible with restricted filesystems.
- Branch protection now requires both `test` and `kind-helm-smoke` checks.
