# v0.5.0-alpha.1 Release Notes

## Scope
`v0.5.0-alpha.1` advances runtime-controls hardening and enterprise retrieval coverage, with CI evidence paths that validate budget/tracing/webhook behavior under kind.

## Highlights
- Runtime-controls foundation hardening for Redis budgets, OTLP export wiring, and resilient webhook operations.
- SharePoint read-only connector (Microsoft Graph) with policy-scoped retrieval and citation-bearing response support.
- CI hardening for runtime-controls and evidence operations (`deploy-smoke`, dead-letter replay smoke, trend regression gate).

## Added
- Connector:
  - `app/rag/connectors/sharepoint.py`
- Scripts:
  - `scripts/replay_webhook_dead_letter.py`
  - `scripts/check_benchmark_trend.py`
- Baseline:
  - `benchmarks/baselines/governance_enforce_redact_summary.json`

## Changed
- Runtime settings:
  - `SRG_RAG_SHAREPOINT_BASE_URL`
  - `SRG_RAG_SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID`
  - `SRG_RAG_SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_ID`
  - `SRG_RAG_SHAREPOINT_BEARER_TOKEN`
  - `SRG_RAG_SHAREPOINT_ALLOWED_PATH_PREFIXES`
  - `SRG_RAG_SHAREPOINT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`
- CI workflow hardening:
  - Redis service in test job for distributed budget coverage
  - webhook dead-letter replay smoke validation
  - governance benchmark trend regression gate
  - kind runtime-controls smoke path in deploy workflow

## Verification Summary
- Local quality gates:
  - `ruff` passes
  - `mypy` passes
  - `pytest` passes
  - schema/version/benchmark checks pass
- Runtime-controls behavior coverage:
  - budget allow/deny accounting
  - OTLP trace chain visibility
  - webhook retry/dead-letter behavior
  - SharePoint connector retrieval/citation path

## Known Limitations
- SharePoint connector is read-only and currently uses bearer-token configuration (no managed identity flow in this prerelease).
- Runtime smoke is scoped to kind-based CI validation; cloud soak coverage is tracked separately.
- This prerelease is for validation and feedback, not final production freeze.
